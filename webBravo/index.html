			<h2 class="line">Problem Statement</h2>
			<div>
			<p><b>Ideal</b>: An interactive web map that shows solar potential of building roof tops in the City of Peterborough so that public and private property owners can determine if solar panel installations are a viable solution for their buildings. The result should be that there is an increase in private sales of solar panels in Peterborough.
			</p>
			<p><b>Reality</b>: Property owners do not currently have access to a free solar potential survey for buildings in the City of Peterborough and may not know that this solution is viable for them.
			</p>
			<p><b>Consequences</b>: Property owners would not have access to freely distributed information on solar potential which could discourage further investigation of solar potential and subsequent solar panel sales. This could hinder the City's progress in reducing its energy consumption and environmental footprint.
			</p>
			<p><b>Proposal</b>: A web map showing solar potential of building roof tops in Peterborough that gives information on total roof area available for solar panel installation and the potential energy production possible through solar panel use. Users can either click on their building or search their address to get this information for their property.

			<h2 class="line">Why Experience Builder?</h2>
			<p>With so many amazing web technologies, it can be a bit overwhelming to choose which one is the best fit. We tested out multiple proprietary and open-source options. Based on the needs of our client and our own skill level, we opted for Esri's Experience Builder - an easily configurable application with nearly instantaneous results.</p>
			<p>Other technologies that we tried were either aimed at navigating more complicated/multi-layer maps (e.g., Geocortex) or would have taken a lot more time for us to customise/configure in order to obtain a similar result to Experience Builder (e.g., leaflet, mapbox). Experience Builder was a good compromise and resulted in an excellent web solution for our Client's purposes.</p>
			
		  	<div class="col-6 pros">
				<h2 class="line line-half">Pros</h2>
				<h3 class="sections pros">Core functionality present.</h3>
				<p>This app will be used by the general public and has a very simple purpose: find a property and understand its solar potential. We thus needed a web app solution that is both simple/intuitive in design, is map-centric, and can be used on multiple devices. In addition, we liked the potential for displaying 2D and 3D layers in one map for future modifications to the app. Experience Builder offers all of this and more. </p>
				<h3 class="sections pros">Easily configurable.</h3>
				<p>Following the path of least resistance is key in software development. If a technology has already been created to do something for you, then it is probably a better option to work with that technology than to recreate it yourself. Experience Builder includes the functionality that we need to address our Client's needs, without a steep learning curve, so it is an obvious choice for us.</p>
				<h3 class="sections pros">Client's preferred choice.</h3>
				<p>Moreover, our clients work a lot with Esri technology and would like to be able to incorporate the app easily into their ArcGIS platform. Working with Experience Builder makes it very easy to go back and forth between web maps and apps, and presumably from app to app as well.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="col-6 cons">
				<h2 class="line line-half">Cons</h2>
				<h3 class="sections pros">Not many customisation options.</h3>
				<p>We quickly discovered that choosing to go the fully configurable app route had its downsides. Noteably, simple customisation tasks (e.g., custom graphs and figures, design ideas) are much harder to do in an app like Experience Builder compared with apps that let you work directly with the code, like leaflet and mapbox. In our case, we were able to do some basic customisation to our popups using Arcade (e.g., simple calculations, graph referencing other layers, etc.); however, we were not satisfied with the final result and would have liked to have more control over our popup design and content.</p>
				<h3 class="sections pros">Not freely available.</h3>
				<p>As an Esri web tech solution, Experience Builder is not free and may not be the ideal choice if the Client does not already have an ArcGIS Online user account.</p>
				<h3 class="sections pros">Difficult to troubleshoot.</h3>
				<p>Experience Builder is one of Esri's newer technologies and the availability of online help documentation and forums is scarce. This will improve with time, along with the availability of more specialised widgets.</p>

			<h3 class="sections">Experience Builder</h3>
			<p>Experience Builder offers much functionality for configuring a multi-page application for showing web maps in 2D or 3D. There are a number of different web app layout options, from fully configured templates to a blank workspace. The layout is created by adding widgets (e.g., maps, text boxes, buttons, etc.). However, unless you have access to the Developer's Edition (and the know-how for using it), the app does not offer a whole lot of customisation options.</p>

			<h3 class="sections">Configure pop-ups in Map Viewer</h3>
			<p>Pop-ups can be configured in the Web Map Viewer for the published map service on ArcGIS Online. In addition to configuration options, the pop-up content can be further customised using Arcade programming language. For instance, if you want calculate a new attribute field.</p>

			<h3 class="sections">Don't be afraid to learn Arcade!</h3>
			<p>Customised content displayed in pop-ups can offer a much more interesting user experience. This can be accomplished with very simple Arcade expressions. With a basic knowledge of programming languages and a bit of google searching, you will have no problem finding a solution to display your data more effectively. </p>
